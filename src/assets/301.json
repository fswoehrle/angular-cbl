The mention of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, in Genesis 2:14, which today flow through Iraq, convinces us that Eden was once an historical place on the earth; most probably in the Middle East.</p><p>Who is this God who created the heavens and the earth, and in the end created man? He is the everlasting God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) who existed before creation. John1:1-4 and Colossians 1:15-16 state that Jesus Christ was with God the Father from the beginning, involved in planning and creating the universe, as was God's Spirit, Genesis 1:1-2. Thus God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, worked together in the creation of the heavens and the earth.</p><p>This God created man in his image, enabling him to love and communicate, as he was a God of love who communicated. He loved man and made him His delight. His God-given task was to subdue the earth and be ruler over God's creation, Genesis 1:28; 2:15. God remained creator, and man remained the created one, lifted to high dignity under God's leadership.</p><p>It is therefore fitting for us to praise God our creator, to love and obey him, and teach our children also to praise, love and obey him and live responsibly in God's creation.</p>"
